Everything starts with knowledge.

Picture the scene. The pressure is on and you need to deliver the project. You need "stuff" to keep stakeholders happy. And you need it now!

It's easy to jump headlong into delivery, into doing before really understanding what your clients need. Never mind balancing that with what your business needs.

knowledge first is about giving you practical help to get to the right insight. Making sure your proposition and marketing is anchored in what matters. I specialise in pensions, platforms and investments, but what I do works in any sector.

I'd love to hear from you, and I'm always happy to meet for an exploratory chat. Get in touch.
